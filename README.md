**Here are some facts about me**
* I really really like to go on vacation around the world because traveling seems very interesting and calming.
* I really want to visit the Bahamas because of the great resorts over there while also being able to go to Hawaii and get
even more tan.
* I love Plushies even though it might seem childish but I really think Plushies can help with anyone's mental illness or anyone who has been under a lot of stress lately.

<b>Some things that I hate</b>
- I really don't appreciate it if anyone takes my food randomly and decides that they want to eat it.
- I don't like being targeted although if you do it, I will do it too.
